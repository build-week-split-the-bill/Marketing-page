                <h3>Split The Bill</h3>
                <p>Login and fill in the blanks and start Splitting The Bill with the group instead of arguing who had what. We developed this application so that the fun could continue even after the check came. <strong>So don't fret any longer</strong>                    when the waiter/waitress comes bearing the check of bad news... instead open up <strong>Split The Bill</strong> and make this a seamlessly simple process. You and your fiends will have no need to banter (except maybe who <strong>actually</strong>                    ordered the breadsticks! lol...). once complete each person gets an email of their copy so that later on everyone is sure that their part was paid. Click <strong>Login</strong> at the top of the page to get started!</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p><strong>Split The Bill</strong> uses a person to person money exchange that removes the middle man. Makes paying your friends for your part of the group bill more secure and without the need to carry all that pesky money you have...lol.</p>
